# MEAN Starterkit
A starterkit for developing projects using the MEAN Stack and other technologies

## Techologies
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used for storing users, threads, replies, blogs, etc. MongoDB is the obvious choice when working with Node.js

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is a MongoDB wrapper that introduces schematics and provides helpful functions when working with the database.

- **Express**: I'm using Express for routing. If I used purely Node.js to route, this project would be much larger. Express is the natural choice when working with Node.js.

- **AngularJS**: AngularJS is being used as my front-end framework. 

- **Node.js**: This piece of technology is being used as my server. Thanks node.

- **Compass**: SASS allows support for nesting, functions, and variables in CSS.

- **Karma/Jasmine**: I am using Jasmine to test and Karma as the test runner.

- **Material Design**: I am using the Angular Material framework for the majority of styling.
